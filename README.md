# PokenoWebsite

Hello! 

This is a Work in Progress utilizing Django to create a website for playing Pokeno. 

Pokeno is like a combination of Bingo and Poker: You start by selecting 25 cards to be your board. After everyone has created their board, one person draws cards from a 52 card deck.
The first five cards that form a row, column, or diagonal on your board become your hand. After every single player has a hand, you compare and see which hand has the highest scoring value. That person wins!

I started this before my C# course with the Tech Academy, so I haven't made too much progress yet. I'm planning to come back and to keep updating this project while working on my job search.

Thank you!
