It turns out this extension needs to account for the folder as well, which is why
it's CardRandomness/base.html, as extends goes directly from the Templates folder-->

                <p class="card-text">Pokeno is basically poker meets bingo! You start by choosing 25 playing cards from a deck of cards, placing them in a 5x5 grid. After everyone has chosen
                    their cards, the game begins with an automated dealer revealing cards slowly one by one. </p>
                <p> Click on your board to mark a card as being revealed!
                    Once you have five cards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), that is your "hand". After everyone has a "hand", whosoever has
                    the highest poker "hand" wins!</p>
